# Python-ML-SalesPrediction

As part of the final project for the Master in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE, in togheter with my team, we made a sales prediction for the Inditex Group, specifically for Zara Women.

Using a set of internal variables provided by the company, we created several new ones and also used external API to enrich the final dataset. After it, we moved on into the modelling section where we trained different tree based algorithms (such as Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGBM) to predict the sales. On average, the final error was of only nine units.
